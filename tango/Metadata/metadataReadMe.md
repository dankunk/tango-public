## Metadata directory (optional)

The `tango/Metadata/` directory is an **optional** place to store sample sheets, notes, and any metadata describing your sequencing files (e.g., sample IDs, conditions, timepoints, replicates, batches, library prep details, SRA accessions, etc.).

**Note:** At the moment, Tango does **not** require or consume files from `tango/Metadata/` to run the workflow. It is provided purely for organization/convenience and future expansion (e.g., downstream DESeq2 setup, sample grouping, rhythmicity analysis, etc.).
